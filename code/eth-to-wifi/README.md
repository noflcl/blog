# Raspberry Pi
## Ethernet to WiFi Hotspot

Simple script to create a WiFi hotspot with a RPI.

Setup:
  - Run `install.sh`
  - Adjust any settings in `hostapd.conf` and `dnsmasq.conf`
  - Run `eth-to-wifi.sh`

If you ever want to change your hotspot settings just adjust the same files and run `eth-to-wifi.sh` again, or reboot the pi.
