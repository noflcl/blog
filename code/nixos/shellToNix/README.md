# Shell Script To Nix
## Taking `.sh` and making it `.nix`

> Once I began to go down the Nix and NixOS rabbit hole there is no going back ðŸ˜‚!

Nix is slowly taking over and replacing every system around me. Until this last year I pretty much settled on Ubuntu Server for all my appliance and application servers which includes pretty much every cloud instance as well. When I first got into Linux I was a serious distro hopper and big Arch fanboi ðŸ«  but as I progressed and managed more systems I started to settle on a familiar home of Ubuntu for all my mission critical systems. All of that us changing now.

Lets take a look at a `bash` script that deploys a generic server, with full disk encryption, remote unlocking, deployed with `Docker`, `KVM`, `ZFS`, `Samba`, `Wireguard`, and a few other things.

## What does the bash script do?

### Usage of script / help menus
The first few lines of my script usually contain a variable that fetches the name of the script that is being executed. 

``` bash
declare _PROGNAME

_PROGNAME=$(basename -- "$0")
```
This variable is handy when putting together a help menu or a notice to a user about how to use this script.

```bash
usage() {
	cat <<EOF

Usage: $_PROGNAME <options>
Options:
    -i, --install		Install software
EOF
}

if [[ "$1" == "" ]]; then
	usage
	exit 0
fi
```

The `usage()` function will be printed to the console if someone runs the script with no arguments giving them a nice "how to use" and the `$_PROGNAME` variable will be printed out with the scripts real name "`install.sh`".

## Decrypt Disks

### `root`
When installing my operating system I *opt in* to enable full disk encryption partnered with `Dropbear` for remote unlocking. I have Dropbear listening on a random port, and store that unique data in my password manager along side the server credentials. I also use a unique keypair seperate from my users SSH keys just for unlocking a disk.

### Bulk Storage
This is my old way of handling luks encrypted storage. After weighing my threat level I settled on the convenience of keyfiles to unlock my encypted storage drives before ZFS mounts them. Since my whole root disk is encrypted already, the keyfile is protected at rest, and it is placed in my root directory with constrained permissions so non root users can't get to it.

My current solution is now using native ZFS encryption which solves every problem for bulk data storage.. But here was my old way of managing encrypted storage pools at boot.

## Software

I use to be all about KVM and wrapping software up in their own isolated environment with a very limited scope of access to the underlying storage and system. Since then, Docker has come to be my defacto standard on softare deployment with very few VM's these days.

# Nix
## Let's get a bit of Nix up in here

If we look over the script it really does three things:
- Sets up the system for remote decryption & decrypting of bulk storage
- Installs the required software for the server
- Configures the software

Since Nix language is nothing like a bash script, what we previously used to deploy systems really can only be used as a roadmap. One thing I want to accomplish is being able to reuse the same nix files across multiple systems but not every device will have all of these services. An easy solution would be to wrap each service in their own `.nix` file and just import the files needed into the config per system.

```nix
import = 
  [
    wireguard.nix
    samba.nix
    ...
  ];
```

## Decrypt Disks

### `root`

Dropbear has nix support and great documentation in the [Nix wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Remote_LUKS_Unlocking). One of the interesting things for Nix is they recommend doing this over Tor ðŸ˜Ž doesn't get much cooler than that.
