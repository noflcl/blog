# Helpdesk
## Allow users to request help

This script creates a Wireguard VPN connection from a client's device to my admin network. Once a device is connected, I am able to remotely administer not only that system but other devices on their network. This allows me to troubleshoot, install software, or push packages with ADB to Android devices and TV's. I created a simple `.desktop` file so users have a nice application icon named "Helpdesk" with a icon that stands out in their applications menu.
