In a world shrouded by chaos, stress, and uncertainty. Rises a champion. One who can encapsulate the fear, supress the anxiety, and free humanity for the monotony of manual work... Well maybe programming isn't a Marvel movie or a Hollywood hacker film come to life. It's more of a slow trudge through endless documentation, Stack Overlfow fu, and YouTube videos with every coder telling you "You're doing that wrong". Who to trust? Who to believe? Maybe that is the true super power of programmers.. Being able to `bullshit.sort()`. 

> You probably wont find the answer to life and everything within this repository. 

What you may find is some useful documentation and maybe some tid bits that could help you out in a bind. Really this "blog" repository is a dumping ground of personal docs, the writings and ramblings of a mid 30's tech enthusiast, and a bunch of random coding projects as I teach myself different technologies around programming.

I found Linux back in 2008, the Ubuntu 8.04 days. I was a previous Windows user but was getting really tired of wiping and reinstalling my operating systems and fixing friends systems all to often... for no pay. An incredibly powerful tool came to my attention, Linux, and I have never looked back!  
Up until recently I had been focused solely on systems administration, orchastration, and system deployment since I was positive this was one day goign to be my career path.  but as I grow and mature my views are changing and my interests are changing with me. I thought what I can't do in `bash`, there is `ansible`, `terraform` and `python` to get er' done. Which I think does ring true for the most part.. Or at least for sys admins.

> eww `JS`. Yup! that was me! ðŸ¤¦

After getting over myself and ego, I picked up Kyle Simpsons book "You don't know JS yet". Damn! that title couldn't be closer to the truth. Every bias I held against the language I realised was rooted in false knowledge, reddit arguments, and click bait YouTube channels from others who don't actually understand the language.

Like an HGTV home renovation show ðŸ˜‰ this is an old Stephen with good bones, he just need some tlc and a few new support pillars to hold up the new additions. 

In steps `JS`. Up to this point I have only played a bit with adjusting scripts and cobbling together working sites with what little I knew about the language. I love the web, I love computers and technology, and I want to learn something new.
