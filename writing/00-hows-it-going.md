# How's It Going?

With February in full swing things are busy! at work üß± üî® & home owners want early spring possesions on houses not even inspected yet üò¨. I'm trying to find time to finish my [shellToNix](https://github.com/noflcl/blog/tree/main/code/nixos/shellToNix) post which is hung up due to remote decryptionüòë. My test nix system is my old laptop, and day to day this server is actually WiFi only which has honestly been rock solid üò∏. Very little data persists on here since I use it to play around with flakes and host a few docker containers that saves their data to the main server. 

Here is the kicker though! the ethernet port is broken üòÜ, no battery (so it really is close to a server), and I'm doing USB 3.0 -> ethernet for this test. ü§Ø Whaaaaat! USB Ethernet? Yup, because riddle me this...

> If you have a fully encrypted disk, and no working internal ethernet port. How do you get early boot networking to remotely decrypt your server?

## ü•Å ... ... ... You Don't!

## USB networking in `boot.initrd`

You neet to get networking up and going early so we hook your `boot.initrd` to handle this. For me I'm using USB Ethernet so I have to get the network interface kernel module loaded and I need to get `usbnet` loaded.

`boot.initrd.availableKernelModules = [ "usbnet" "rtsx_pci" ]`

There is much more to be done here but suffice to say I don't have early boot networking over USB yet. I'm tempted to buy a replacement port on eBay since they are like $3 + some shipping. 

If I solve this issue I will be ready to move my core 3 servers over to NixOS. The first system to update will be my DNS server which is fully disk encrypted and wired in the networking closet.
